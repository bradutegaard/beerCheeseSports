        I’ll start this off by saying, I’m not a draft expert. I don’t have any insider information, I’ve only skimmed player evaluations, and I haven’t watched a single second of all 22 film. I’m just a fan, but I think I have pretty good instincts, I’ve watched a few highlight tapes, and I’ve looked up some measurables. So, I’m going to tell you what I want the Packers to do with their first-round pick whether you’re interested or not.

        There are a few important things I believe that are informing my desires for the Packers pick at 30 overall. First, I believe the Packers need to be in the ultimate win now mode. Aaron Rodgers is now older than Brett Favre was when the Packers drafted Aaron Rodgers. Fortunately, like Favre, I think Rodgers still has plenty of gas left in the tank, but he’s not getting any younger.

        With one of the shortest championship windows in the entire NFL, I believe the Packers have a clear path to winning the NFC North for the second straight year. The Vikings traded away Stefon Diggs, who’s always been a bit of a Packer killer. Seriously, he scored a touchdown in every game he played against the Packers since his rookie year. The Bears are awesomely mismanaged. They already don’t have a first round pick this year and they traded a fourth-round pick for an overpaid 31-year-old Nick Foles to compete with Trubisky instead of bringing in Cam Newton for no picks. They also brought in Jimmy Graham to play with the worst QB of his career, and Packers fans sadly know he just doesn’t have it anymore. And the Lions are the Lions. But, they also traded away an elite cornerback in Darius Slay.

        With a stronger NFC North, a first-year head coach, new offensive scheme, and a completely revamped defense the Packers went 13-3 last year and were just one game we won’t talk about away from the Superbowl. So, I believe the Packers need to be designing their team to be the kind of juggernaut that can take down the top teams in the NFL. Now, here are the things I want the Packers to do with their first pick in the draft…

        <strong>1. Trade up</strong><br></br>
There are four WR’s in this draft who I would jump off my couch and tear off my shirt for if the Packers got in this Draft. They are Jerry Jeudy, CeeDee Lamb, Henry Ruggs, and Justin Jefferson in that order. A lot is up in the air about where these WR’s will go in this draft since the class is so deep, but it seems unlikely any of them will fall to 30. I would also be ecstatic to bring in Isaiah Simmons or 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>2. Trade it away</strong><br></br>
        If the Packers can bring in an established offensive weapon for their first pick, I say do it! The best predictor for NFL success is success in the NFL. With such a small championship window, if you’re choosing between a guy who has done it before and a spinning the wheel on a talented rookie, bring in the guy who has done it before. As unlikely as it seems there have been trade rumors about OBJ. Imagine if the Packers had turned their first pick into Deandre Hopkins across from Davante Adams. It still would have been more than the Cardinals gave up. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>3. WR</strong><br></br>
        This comes with a caveat; I want the Packers to prioritize speed and quickness over size. It has only been two years, but Brian Gutekunst seems to love big WR’s more than a fat kid loves cake. And even after my top four WRs, this draft class must still look like a whole bakery to him. He drafted three WR’s in his first draft who were 6’3, 6’4, and 6’5 respectively and this off season he brought in Devin Funchess who is 6’4 and a few weeks of Wisconsin beer and cheese away from being a TE. I would prefer Denzel Mims then Jalen Reagor then Brandon Aiyuk at 30, but I would expect Gutey to grab Tee Higgins or Chase Claypool if they’re there.

            <strong>4. Trade down</strong><br></br>
            I’ve heard a lot of people starting to say that it is time to take the QB of the future at 30, especially if Jordan Love is still there. I just feel like that would be good for the future, but essentially resigning to be just good for the next 5 or so years. It is true that with the Colts sitting at pick 34 it seems unlikely that Love will fall past that. But I don’t really care. If he does take him there with more picks, if he doesn’t fill some positions you actually need. Maybe the get two talented WRs or an extra LB or a DB that they really need. 


Essentially, I don’t want to the Packers to pick at 30. The draft is a gamble so I could look like an idiot afterwards. But I never claimed I wasn’t. On Thursday night, I just want to feel like the Packers are already a better team. Not a team with a better back up QB.
